CHANGELOG

version 4.2 (2022-01-24):
        (SOME EXTRA BYTE VALUES HAVE CHANGED! YOU WILL PROBABLY
        HAVE TO RE-PLACE ALL THE SPRITES IN YOUR LEVEL.)
        - added an option for different sprite sizes (16x16, 16x32 and 32x32)
        - added an option to make a sprite invisible
        - improved the handling of solid sprites
        - added an option to make solid sprites rideable
        - added an option to set the player's pose to the default when talking to the sprite
        - fixed an issue where showing a VWF message would cause a sprite to never despawn
        - switched the "left" and "right" labels for the initial direction because they were apparently the wrong way round?
        - made the sprite compatible with the upcoming version of the VWF dialogues patch

version 4.1 (2022-01-07):
        - the palette no longer switches back to E when a VWF message is shown
        - the sprite no longer hurts yoshi
        - the configuration tool now lets you specify a custom graphic for the sprite even when it's set to be stationary
        - fixed an issue where you could talk to solid sprites if you were directly below or above them
        - fixed an issue with the jump sound when AMK is applied
        - fixed an issue with the standing frame selection in the configuration tool
          (this also means the two walking frames in the GFX file are now swapped, so please reinsert the graphics)
