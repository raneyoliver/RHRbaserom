; These are designed to not give you an item reserve powerup if you already have a powerup,

!Freeze = 0 ; Change to 0 to skip freeze during powerup animation

;!ItemBoxReserve = 1 ; If you already have the powerup, will place a copy in item reserve

print "Various powerups, and one-up. I was too lazy to make anything other than the mushroom give you an item reserve backup when you get a secohnd one. (Lemme know and I can tell you how to fix it.) The different powerups are actually all just a single block, set to give you the correct powerup depending on the act-as. Apologies for any jank. If you want to be able to get a ton of one-ups in a row with no delay in the sound, there's an Uber for that: OneUpSoundDelayQueueRemove.asm."
